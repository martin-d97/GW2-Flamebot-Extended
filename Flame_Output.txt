## W7 - *5m41s* (without gate)
## **[QTP CM](https://dps.report/hcyF-20250810-102935_qpeer)** **5m38s (66%:wing:)**
**MVPs** 
* __Locksmith God__ / __John Fking Wick__ didn't do any **CC**
* __Beauty Pageant__ / __ThirdOrigin__ / __Rem__ / __Death Touched Lexi__ / __John Fking Wick__ got hit by the arrow mechanic. Remember, you can jump them. Work on your timing next time!
* __Samara__ got hit by **orange circle AoE lightning hits**. Please move out, or dodge them the next time.
* __Maybe Momo__ please work on your **Protection** uptime! It reduces strike damage your group takes, therefore people may survive longer and you will need to heal less!
* __Locksmith God__, remember to cheer up the squad after dying early in the fight! Good morale helps a ton.
**LVPs** 
* __Samara__ thanks for doing **5850** **CC** (**33.3%** of the squad)
* Looks like __Beauty Pageant__ / __Incinerate This__ / __Kev The Troublesome__ are **pylon kiters** today. At least these DPS players contribute **something** to the society.
